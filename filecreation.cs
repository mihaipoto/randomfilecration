            var intervalSeconds = random.Next(minIntervalSeconds, maxIntervalSeconds + 1); // Generate a random interval

In this example:

The application sets up the necessary variables such as the directory path where the files will be created, the minimum and maximum file sizes (in kilobytes), and the minimum and maximum intervals (in seconds) between file creations.
The application creates the specified directory if it doesn't exist.
Inside the infinite while loop, it generates a random file size within the specified range and creates a file with random content using a FileStream. The file name includes a unique identifier generated by Guid.NewGuid().
The path of the created file is printed to the console.
The application then generates a random interval between file creations using the Thread.Sleep method, causing the program to pause execution for a specific number of seconds before the next file creation.
Please note that this example continuously creates files, and you will need to manually stop the application when you want to end the file creation process.
